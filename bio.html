                      My name is Jack Wang. I am currently a senior at Northwestern University studying Economics and Computer Science, graduating in June 2023, and I am looking to work in finance. I transferred from Washington University in St. Louis because I wanted to be a part of a bigger metropolitan city. I was also born in Chicago, but moved to New Jersey when I was one years old, so I never had any recollection of Chicago. Therefore, I desired to transfer to Northwestern to fulfill my eagerness to experience the lifestyle at my birthplace.

                        I have had a lot of diverse professional experiences. I worked on a data analysis case for ProMazo. Within finance, I have had experience in various facets. Iâ€™ve worked in Private Equity at First Light Capital Partners, Debt and Equity Capital Markets as a Syndicate Intern at Wedbush Securities, and in the Markets as a Sales and Trading Intern at Jane Street.

                        Deviating adjacent to my workplace experience, I also want to highlight my unique table tennis experience. I used to be a former U.S National Team Member, and I represented the United States in competing in international competitions across the globe. I also have many hobbies. I love a lot of other sports, working out, singing, rapping, playing the piano, attending music festivals, cooking, and traveling.
